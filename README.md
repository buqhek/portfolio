# A Little About Me
Hello! ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Hektor Buqaj. I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan, currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Engineering in Data science. As a member of the Michigan Data Science Team, a cohort member of M-Stem, and a proud member of the Albanian American Student Association, I strongly believe in the collaboration and cooperation towards making a better tomorrow.  

I'm a firm believer that the stories we tell and hear around us hold power, and have the ability to change people. As a data science student, I've become more accustomed to reading the stories in the data I work through. As a result, I hope to take my skills and make the story we'll tell about the future to be a better one.  

I'm highly passionate about sustainable technology practices, with additional interest in various other fields, such as game development.  

As the 24-25 school year comes to a close, I am planning to continue my MDST chatbot project to learn more about RAG, function calling, few shot prompting, and agents. As a video game hobbyist, I'm currently spending my coding passion and working with the Fabric API to develop a Minecraft mod, and further refine my skills in scripting for fun.

# Projects

### Power Outage Analysis | [Link](https://buqhek.github.io/power_outages_analysis/)
- Developed a regression model using scikit-learn to predict electricity prices based on power outage data, achieving a 84% reduction in mean squared error through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

- Implemented data preprocessing pipelines for mixed data types (categorical, numerical, and datetime), incorporating custom temporal feature engineering to extract business-relevant patterns from outage timestamps.

- Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis on a 1,400+ record dataset of U.S. power outages (2000-2016), visualizing regional patterns and temporal trends to identify key predictive features

<!-- ### MDST: LLM Augmentation - Eventure | Website soon!
- Worked with a team to develop an AI chatbot utilizing OpenAI's API alongside Ticketmaster's API to build a traveling product for users who are interested in building itineraries when they travel.

- Focused on integrating APIs and building pipelines for our OpenAI API to seamlessly interact with user queries and the frontend of our product. -->

### MDST: Research Grant Analysis | [Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGWwTYnXlg/nAtzd2Eopv9MCZ6SEbqq6w/edit?utm_content=DAGWwTYnXlg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
- Practiced utilizing the pandas library with plotly to analyze and build visualizations of my findings and trends.

- Developed a deliverable presentation to showcase my findings.
  
### Minecraft 1.21.1 Fabric Mod | [Github](https://github.com/buqhek/Fabric-Tutorial-1.21.1)
- Utilizing KaupenJoe's tutorial series, since it provides a strong foundation for setting up and understanding Fabric modding basics.

- Utilizing the fabric framework to build advanced features using Minecraft 1.21.1 updates like cherry blossom biomes and archaeology.

- Focus on clean, modular code supports adding new functionalities and ensuring compatibility.
