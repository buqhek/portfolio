## A Little About Me
Hello! ðŸ‘‹  

My name is Hektor Buqaj. I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan, currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Engineering in Data science. As a member of the Michigan Data Science Team, a cohort member of M-Stem, and a proud member of the Albanian American Student Association, I strongly believe in the collaboration and cooperation towards making a better tomorrow.  

I'm a firm believer that the stories we tell and hear around us hold power, and have the ability to change people. As a data science student, I've become more accustomed to reading the stories in the data I work through. As a result, I hope to take my skills and make the story we'll tell about the future to be a better one.  

I'm highly passionate about sustainable technology practices, with additional interest in various other fields, such as game development.  

I'm currently working on the Michigan Data Science Team's research grant analysis project. As a video game hobbyist, I'm currently spending my free time working with the Fabric API to develop a Minecraft mod, and further refine my skills in scripting.  


**Proficient Technical Skills:** C++, Python, 

**Skills I'm Learning :** C#, Javascript, Github

**Soft Skills:** Communication, Organization, Teamwork, Problem Solving, Time Management
